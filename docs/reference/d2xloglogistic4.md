# Second Derivative of the loglogistic4 Model (Numerical)

Approximates \\d^2y/dx^2\\ for
[`loglogistic4()`](https://immunoplex.github.io/curveRfreq/reference/loglogistic4.md)
via central difference.

## Usage

``` r
d2xloglogistic4(x, a, b, c, d, h = 1e-05)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Numeric vector. Independent variable (typically log-concentration).

- a:

  Numeric scalar. Lower (left) asymptote — baseline response at zero
  concentration or infinite dilution.

- b:

  Numeric scalar. Scale (slope) parameter controlling steepness of the
  transition region. Sign determines curve direction.

- c:

  Numeric scalar. Inflection-point location on the x-axis (midpoint).

- d:

  Numeric scalar. Upper (right) asymptote — maximum response at
  saturating concentration.

- h:

  Numeric scalar. Finite-difference step size. Default `1e-5`.

## Value

Numeric vector of second-derivative values.
