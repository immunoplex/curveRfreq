# Second Derivative of the Gompertz Model

Computes \\d^2y/dx^2\\ analytically for
[`gompertz4()`](https://immunoplex.github.io/curveRfreq/reference/gompertz4.md):
\$\$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = b^2\\(d - a)\\e_2\\(e_2 - 1)\\\exp(-e_2)
\quad\text{where } e_2 = \exp(-b(x - c))\$\$

## Usage

``` r
d2xgompertz4(x, a, b, c, d)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Numeric vector. Independent variable (typically log-concentration).

- a:

  Numeric scalar. Lower (left) asymptote — baseline response at zero
  concentration or infinite dilution.

- b:

  Numeric scalar. Scale (slope) parameter controlling steepness of the
  transition region. Sign determines curve direction.

- c:

  Numeric scalar. Inflection-point location on the x-axis (midpoint).

- d:

  Numeric scalar. Upper (right) asymptote — maximum response at
  saturating concentration.

## Value

Numeric vector of second-derivative values.
