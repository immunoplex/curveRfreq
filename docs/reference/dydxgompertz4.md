# First Derivative of the Gompertz Model

Computes \\dy/dx\\ analytically for
[`gompertz4()`](https://immunoplex.github.io/curveRfreq/reference/gompertz4.md):
\$\$\frac{dy}{dx} = b\\(d - a)\\u\\\exp(-u) \quad\text{where } u =
\exp(-b(x - c))\$\$

## Usage

``` r
dydxgompertz4(x, a, b, c, d)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Numeric vector. Independent variable (typically log-concentration).

- a:

  Numeric scalar. Lower (left) asymptote — baseline response at zero
  concentration or infinite dilution.

- b:

  Numeric scalar. Scale (slope) parameter controlling steepness of the
  transition region. Sign determines curve direction.

- c:

  Numeric scalar. Inflection-point location on the x-axis (midpoint).

- d:

  Numeric scalar. Upper (right) asymptote — maximum response at
  saturating concentration.

## Value

Numeric vector of first-derivative values.
